# Library App

Goal of this project is to learn object orientated programming.

## What have I learnd?

- Object constructor
- Object Protptype
- Prototypal inferitence
- KISS principle - I wanted to much from the start and soon I was to deep and didn't saw head nor tail of the project. After realization of this I remeberd KISS principle (Keep It Stupidly Simple) and start to implement simple logic and after that I can start add more complicated features.
